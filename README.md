# Apex-Legends-Scripts
My personal scripts for Apex Legends. They are not intended to be use for cheating.

## AutoHotKey scripts
###  	[ApexLegendsExitMacro.ahk](https://github.com/Snorchy/Apex-Legends-Scripts/blob/master/Scripts/AutoHotKey/ApexLegendsExitMacro.ahk):
This script is just a macro that combines mouse clicks and keyboard keypresses to automatically exit from the current game and search for a new one as fast as possible. To run it you need to have the program AutoHotKey installed and then execute the .ahk file provided in this repository. The main limitation for now is that it only works on 1920x1080 resolutions because it tells the computer where to look and click by using pixels. But it can probably be adapted to be multires.

**DISCLAIMER:**
I HOPE any of my scripts are not considered cheating by Respawn or anyone else since I'm not influencing the match itself in any way. What some of my do script is just automating tedious manual processes that can be done manually. I just do it because I am very lazy and I like programming, not for any other benefit.
